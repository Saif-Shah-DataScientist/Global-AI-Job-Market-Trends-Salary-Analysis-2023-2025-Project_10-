# Global AI Job Market Trends and Salary Analysis (2023–2025)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the global job market for Artificial Intelligence (AI) roles between 2023 and 2025. It focuses on understanding hiring demand, salary trends, skill requirements, and regional differences to help professionals and organizations navigate the evolving AI employment landscape.

## Objectives
- Analyze AI job postings to identify high-demand roles and regions  
- Explore salary trends across countries and experience levels  
- Identify essential technical and soft skills for AI positions  
- Study the relationship between skill count and salary brackets  
- Provide strategic insights for job seekers and hiring managers  

## Dataset
- File: ai_job_dataset.csv  
- Source: Aggregated global AI job listings dataset (Google or Kaggle-based source)  
- Key Columns: Country, Job_Title, Salary_USD, Experience_Level, Employment_Type, Skills, Remote_Ratio, Year  

## Tools and Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## Steps Performed
1. Data loading and inspection  
2. Cleaning and preprocessing of job, salary, and skill data  
3. Feature engineering (e.g., skill count, salary categorization)  
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
5. Visualization of hiring demand, salary distribution, and skill patterns  
6. Insights and interpretation  
7. Executive summary of global AI job trends  

## Key Insights
- AI hiring is accelerating globally, especially in the U.S., U.K., India, and Germany.  
- Senior-level AI roles have grown the fastest and command the highest salaries.  
- Remote AI positions are increasingly common, particularly post-2022.  
- Machine Learning Engineer, Data Scientist, and AI Researcher are the most in-demand roles.  
- Python, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, SQL, and NLP rank as the most valuable skills.  
- A higher skill count correlates strongly with higher salary levels.

## Executive Summary
The global AI job market is expanding rapidly, with high hiring demand and growing salaries across key regions.  
Data Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer, and AI Researcher roles dominate hiring activity.  
Salaries are highest in the U.S., U.K., and Germany, with senior-level professionals commanding top compensation.

Python, Machine Learning, and Data Analytics remain foundational skills, while cloud and deep learning expertise are increasingly sought after.  
The findings indicate continued growth in demand for AI professionals through 2025, especially for candidates with strong technical and practical project experience.
